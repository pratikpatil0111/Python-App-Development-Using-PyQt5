# Python-App-Development-Using-PyQt5
This repository contains a collection of Python-based applications built with **PyQt**, **SQL**, **Matplotlib**, **Pillow (PIL)**, and **Lambda functions**. The main components of the project include a Starter App, Calculator, Image Editor, and Expense Tracker, designed to be user-friendly and functional. 

### Calculator
A simple **Calculator** application supporting basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), built using **PyQt** for a responsive graphical interface. This tool is ideal for performing quick calculations.

### Image Editor
The **Image Editor** allows users to load images, apply basic edits such as resizing,reshaping, cropping, and adjusting brightness or contrast,and save edited images. It uses **Pillow (PIL)** for image manipulation and has a GUI built with **PyQt**.

### Expense Tracker
The **Expense Tracker** helps users track daily expenses. It uses **SQL** to store transaction data and a **PyQt** interface for input and data visualization.

## Features

- Modular architecture with individual apps
- Simple and intuitive PyQt-based GUIs
- Ability to perform basic calculations (Calculator)
- Edit images (resize, crop, brightness adjustment) with **Pillow**
- Track expenses and generate reports with **SQL**

## Technologies Used

- **Python** - Core language
- **PyQt** - GUI framework
- **SQL** - Data storage for the Expense Tracker
- **Pillow (PIL)** - Image editing for the Image Editor
- **Lambda** - Custom logic functions for data processing
